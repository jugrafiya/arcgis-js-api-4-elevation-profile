# ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.7 Elevation Profile

As for now, there is no Elevation Profile widget available for ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.7 that was available in ArcGIS JavaScript API 3.27. So, I have written a code using ArcGIS API 4.7, to use the geoprocessor to get the elevation of the data and then using Chart.js JavaScript
s charting library of show that data on the map.




## Key Components

1- Using ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.7 

2- Using Chart JS Library for Drawign Charts

3- Responsive Charts

4- Draw Line on the Map



Raise an issue, if you use this repository, to allow me refine/modify my code.
